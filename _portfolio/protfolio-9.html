During my internship at LENORET Shanghai Nuotong, I independently designed a 100KW cascade heat pump system for hot and cold water supply, completing theoretical calculations, parameter selection, contacting manufacturers, creating 3D models and engineering drawings, and performing overall simulations. I also conducted the design analysis and modeling of the heat pump system and received the 'Outstanding Professional Internship' award.
