Inspired by the cat's paw, a deformable wheel mechanism that extends and retracts like a cat's paw is proposed for design and manufacture. When road conditions are poor or adhesion requirements are high, the wheel can switch to claw mode, allowing it to dig and push back soft sand and mud for navigating complex terrains and achieving autonomous escape.
